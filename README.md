This study analyzes user acceptance of an AI-based smart parking system at the University of Mataram using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A new variable, Enjoyment, is introduced and found to strongly influence Perceived Usefulness, Ease of Use, and overall user intention. Results show that Perceived Enjoyment is the dominant factor driving stakeholder acceptance. The findings support future decision-making for implementing smart parking technology on campus.
